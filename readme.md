# di.fm now playing scraper

Simple scraper to keep track of the tracks that are played on di.fm

# How to start?
1) Install node
2) `npm install`
3) `npm start`

or if you got yarn, `yarn && yarn start`

# Why
I was looking for some other stuff to add in my playlists and spotify's suggestions are not really cutting it for me.

# Now what
Once it ran for a while you can list what been played with
`npm run channel :channelname` or `yarn channel :channelname`

## Example;
`yarn channel goapsy` lists all goapsy that have been played since it started to track.

To simply see all channels, omit the channel's name altogether

# Slow?
As this is just a small tool, its ran in source thus typescript has to compile it first
